          I love the early morning quiet of a weekend to myself. I’m a single
          mother. I don’t get a lot of quiet mornings. I have a different kind
          of appreciation for a morning with my children, but quiet mornings on
          my own are savored — especially when it’s early enough that it feels
          like the whole world is still sleeping. I’m walking my dog through the
          morning mist when I stop to check the time on my phone and get the
          message that punches through the quiet. Apparently, I’m a total MILF.
          I know that it’s meant to be a compliment, but it misses the mark by a
          million miles. Somehow, it’s worse that the message comes from someone
          I considered a friend rather than an anonymous man on the Internet.
          The morning quiet fell to pieces — or I did. What You Should Know
          About Calling Women MILFs For the uninitiated, MILF stands for “Moms
          I’d Like to Fuck”. It’s a pretty direct indicator of the type of
          interest being expressed. It also manages to take our humanity out of
          the equation entirely by referring to us by our relationship to other
          people. For those who use it, here’s what you should probably know.
          Yes, we know. Let’s just clear something up. Most women know that
          there are men out there who consider us fuckable. We learn that early
          — so early in fact, that the first time we realize it, most of us
          aren’t even women yet. We’re just girls, still playing with Barbie and
          looking at the world through guileless eyes. I was probably twelve the
          first time I was objectified. The worst part is that I was a little
          flattered by it. I was a shy child, used to being the wallflower. The
          attention felt a little like someone was seeing me. Only I knew that
          there was something wrong with how they were seeing me, even if I
          didn’t yet understand what it meant. It’s not a compliment. So, no, I
          don’t find it flattering when someone points out that they’d like to
          fuck me. I know there are people who would. I don’t need a hundred
          people who want to fuck me — just one right person who wants to hold
          me. Is that really too much to ask? There’s not a dad equivalent. I’ve
          never heard women talk about a man who happens to be a father as a
          DILF. It’s not really a prevalent thing. I know some women also
          objectify men. I’m aware. But the vast majority of us are capable of
          feeling sexual attraction for a man who happens to be a father without
          sliding into their DMs to point out that they are parents who are also
          fuckable. “MILF” used as anything other than a joke communicates
          misogyny, not flirtation. If your objective was sex, you failed. I
          don’t have an issue talking about sex, thinking about it, or having
          it. Like many single people in a pandemic, I’d like to be having more
          of it. I’m lonely sometimes, and I have the same human needs — likely
          amplified by a high sex drive with little chance of satisfying it with
          another person at this particular point in time (see: single parent,
          pandemic, men sending messages like this). But I certainly won’t be
          having any of it with someone who puts sex first and my humanity
          later. This shouldn’t be hard to understand, and yet, this message was
          a familiar one. It’s not the first time I’ve been called a MILF, and
          it’s certainly not the first time I’ve been sexually objectified. It
          happens with strangers, with friends, and even in relationships. I’m
          tired. It took a quiet, beautiful morning and punched a hole directly
          through it. There are countless ways to communicate interest to
          another human being without making them feel like an object to be used
          rather than a person to be cared about or loved. That’s what we all
          want, isn’t it? To be seen, to be known, to be loved. I want to share
          my life with someone who wants to fuck me but also wants to love me.
          We are more than the sum of our parts, and we all deserve to have a
          little affection and humanity served up with sexuality and attraction.
          But what about women who don’t mind it? Just because women sometimes
          participate in their own oppression doesn’t mean we should endorse it.
          After all, there are many people who are perfectly fine with toxic
          relationships. This shouldn’t set the standard for the rest of us.
          There are women who have taken their power back by reclaiming the term
          MILF, much in the way many have reclaimed “bitch”. I understand the
          desire to do so, and I don’t have a problem with it. I do, however,
          have a problem with just how prevalent this term is used in society
          without first establishing that it’s acceptable — or questioning if it
          should be. I used to love those Laura Numeroff books. If You Give a
          Mouse a Cookie was a personal favorite. It went something like “If you
          give a mouse a cookie, he’s going to ask for a glass of milk.” The
          entire book is about cause and effect. I was thinking about it today
          when the smoke cleared after the message landed, and I wasn’t feeling
          that sense of shame that seems to accompany sexually degrading
          messages, the sadness of seeing a fellow human being in a new and
          unflattering light, and the anger that this keeps happening. It’s just
          cause and effect. If you call a mom a MILF, she’s going to block you
          on social media. If she blocks you on social media, she’s probably
          going to tell a few friends about what happened. When she tells a few
          friends what happened, she’s going to need a glass of wine. When she
          gets a glass of wine, she’s going to remember that she needs chocolate
          to go with it. And so on. So, if the point of calling a mom a MILF is
          to connect in any way, shape, or form, it might work in one out of a
          hundred women, but I can guarantee that it won’t work with me. It’s
          not flattering. It doesn’t serve the intended purpose. Maybe it’s time
          to retire the expression and just try to connect with each other as
          human beings instead.
