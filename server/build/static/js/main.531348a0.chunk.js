I\u2019m walking my dog through the morning mist when I stop to check the time on my phone and get the message that punches through the quiet. Apparently, I\u2019m a total MILF. I know that it\u2019s meant to be a compliment, but it misses the mark by a million miles.

What You Should Know About Calling Women MILFs For the uninitiated, MILF stands for \u201cMoms I\u2019d Like to Fuck\u201d. It\u2019s a pretty direct indicator of the type of interest being expressed. It also manages to take our humanity out of the equation entirely by referring to us by our relationship to other people. For those who use it, here\u2019s what you should probably know. Yes, we know. Let\u2019s just clear something up. Most women know that there are men out there who consider us fuckable. We learn that early \u2014 so early in fact, that the first time we realize it, most of us aren\u2019t even women yet. We\u2019re just girls, still playing with Barbie and looking at the world through guileless eyes. I was probably twelve the first time I was objectified. The worst part is that I was a little flattered by it. I was a shy child, used to being the wallflower. The attention felt a little like someone was seeing me. Only I knew that there was something wrong with how they were seeing me, even if I didn\u2019t yet understand what it meant. It\u2019s not a compliment. So, no, I don\u2019t find it flattering when someone points out that they\u2019d like to fuck me. I know there are people who would. I don\u2019t need a hundred people who want to fuck me \u2014 just one right person who wants to hold me. Is that really too much to ask? There\u2019s not a dad equivalent. I\u2019ve never heard women talk about a man who happens to be a father as a DILF. It\u2019s not really a prevalent thing. I know some women also objectify men. I\u2019m aware. But the vast majority of us are capable of feeling sexual attraction for a man who happens to be a father without sliding into their DMs to point out that they are parents who are also fuckable. \u201cMILF\u201d used as anything other than a joke communicates misogyny, not flirtation. If your objective was sex, you failed. I don\u2019t have an issue talking about sex, thinking about it, or having it. Like many single people in a pandemic, I\u2019d like to be having more of it. I\u2019m lonely sometimes, and I have the same human needs \u2014 likely amplified by a high sex drive with little chance of satisfying it with another person at this particular point in time (see: single parent, pandemic, men sending messages like this). But I certainly won\u2019t be having any of it with someone who puts sex first and my humanity later. This shouldn\u2019t be hard to understand, and yet, this message was a familiar one. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been called a MILF, and it\u2019s certainly not the first time I\u2019ve been sexually objectified. It happens with strangers, with friends, and even in relationships. I\u2019m tired. It took a quiet, beautiful morning and punched a hole directly through it. There are countless ways to communicate interest to another human being without making them feel like an object to be used rather than a person to be cared about or loved. That\u2019s what we all want, isn\u2019t it? To be seen, to be known, to be loved. I want to share my life with someone who wants to fuck me but also wants to love me. We are more than the sum of our parts, and we all deserve to have a little affection and humanity served up with sexuality and attraction. But what about women who don\u2019t mind it? Just because women sometimes participate in their own oppression doesn\u2019t mean we should endorse it. After all, there are many people who are perfectly fine with toxic relationships. This shouldn\u2019t set the standard for the rest of us. There are women who have taken their power back by reclaiming the term MILF, much in the way many have reclaimed \u201cbitch\u201d. I understand the desire to do so, and I don\u2019t have a problem with it. I do, however, have a problem with just how prevalent this term is used in society without first establishing that it\u2019s acceptable \u2014 or questioning if it should be. I used to love those Laura Numeroff books. If You Give a Mouse a Cookie was a personal favorite. It went something like \u201cIf you give a mouse a cookie, he\u2019s going to ask for a glass of milk.\u201d The entire book is about cause and effect. I was thinking about it today when the smoke cleared after the message landed, and I wasn\u2019t feeling that sense of shame that seems to accompany sexually degrading messages, the sadness of seeing a fellow human being in a new and unflattering light, and the anger that this keeps happening. It\u2019s just cause and effect. If you call a mom a MILF, she\u2019s going to block you on social media. If she blocks you on social media, she\u2019s probably going to tell a few friends about what happened. When she tells a few friends what happened, she\u2019s going to need a glass of wine. When she gets a glass of wine, she\u2019s going to remember that she needs chocolate to go with it. And so on. So, if the point of calling a mom a MILF is to connect in any way, shape, or form, it might work in one out of a hundred women, but I can guarantee that it won\u2019t work with me. It\u2019s not flattering. It doesn\u2019t serve the intended purpose. Maybe it\u2019s time to retire the expression and just try to connect with each other as human beings instead."})})})]})}),f=a(23),p=(a(52),function(){return Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"review",children:[Object(l.jsx)(f.a,{size:24}),Object(l.jsx)(f.b,{size:24}),Object(l.jsx)(c.a,{size:24})]})});a(53);function w(e){var t=e.children;return Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"main-layout",children:[Object(l.jsx)(m,{}),t]})}a(54);function g(e){var t=e.children;return Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"blank-layout",children:t})}var v=a(10),x=a.n(v),y=a(13),O=a(38),I=a(33),k=a.n(I).a.create({baseURL:"/api/",headers:{"content-text":"application/json"}});k.interceptors.request.use(function(){var e=Object(y.a)(x.a.mark((function e(t){return x.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.abrupt("return",t);case 1:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(t){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}()),k.interceptors.response.use(function(){var e=Object(y.a)(x.a.mark((function e(t){return x.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.abrupt("return",t);case 1:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(t){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}(),(function(e){throw e}));var N=function(){return k.get("articles")},_=(a(74),function(){return Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"site-bar",children:[Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"row",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col col-12",children:Object(l.jsx)(u,{})})}),Object(l.jsx)("hr",{}),Object(l.jsx)(j,{})]})}),M=function(){var e=Object(s.useState)([]),t=Object(O.a)(e,2),a=t[0],i=t[1];return Object(s.useEffect)((function(){function e(){return(e=Object(y.a)(x.a.mark((function e(){return x.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:try{N().then((function(e){var t=e.data;i(t),console.log(t)}))}catch(t){}case 1:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})))).apply(this,arguments)}!function(){e.apply(this,arguments)}()}),[]),Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"home",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"container",children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"col lg-8",children:["    ",Object(l.jsx)(h,{articles:a})]}),Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col lg-4",children:Object(l.jsx)(_,{})})]})})})},L=(a(75),a(34)),F=a.n(L),T=function(){return Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"container",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"row",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col lg-4 o-lg-4",children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"login-page",children:[Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"login-page__logo",children:"MEDIUM"}),Object(l.jsx)("h3",{className:"login-page__title",children:"Sign In"}),Object(l.jsx)(F.a,{appId:"1541598222864427",autoLoad:!0,fields:"name,email,picture",callback:function(e){console.log(e)},cssClass:"my-facebook-button-class",icon:"fa-facebook"}),","]})})})})},W=(a(76),function(){return Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"detail-page",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"container",children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"row mt-4",children:[Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col lg-2",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"detail-page__left",children:Object(l.jsx)(p,{})})}),Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col lg-8",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"detail-page__center",children:Object(l.jsx)(b,{})})}),Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"col lg-2",children:Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"detail-page__right",children:Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"I love the early morning quiet of a weekend to myself.
